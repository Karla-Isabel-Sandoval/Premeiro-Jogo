'Hello World'

Finally got around to following the Github how to create your first commit/ repository. And here it is.
I am learning Javascript with Girl Develop It, Women Who Code and Khan Academy. My gateway to coding was the Python Tutorial via Code Academy. Very interested in finding Javascript and Rails coaches who are able to commit one to two hours per day from July to September to troubleshoot as we embark on a Ruby learning journey.

Cheers~
